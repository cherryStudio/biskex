= Why a Quick AdSense fork? =

Quick Adsense is a great plugin and used by more than 100.000 websites. 
Although is not under maintainance and development for more than 3 years by the original author it is still downloaded hundred times a day.
So i decided to continue the project to make sure the plugin will also work in future with new WordPress versions.

Deprecated functions removed, bugs fixed and new filters and hooks created to make this plugin extensible by third party developers!

<strong>We Guarantee: </strong><br>
No revenue sharing from your Google AdSense advertising income. We never show our ads on your website.<br>
We are an active and engaged member of the WordPress community and we are following strongly the WordPress Codex in terms of code quality and good behave.

= Main Features =

* Import all ads settings from Quick AdSense v. 1.9.2 and convert them into serialized options.
* Visibility conditions, show / hide ads based on post type and user roles (needs WP QUADS PRO)
* Quicktags of Quick Adsense are 100% compatible to Quick AdSense Reloaded
* No external script dependencies. All plugin code reside on your site. 
* Dynamic AdSense positioning: Assign Google AdSense ads to the beginning, middle and end of post, assign ads after 'more' tag, before last paragraph, after certain paragraphs & assign Ads after certain images.
* Insert Google AdSense ads specifically or randomly anywhere within a post.
* Support any Ads code, not limited to Google Adsense ads only.
* Display up to a maximum of 10 Ads on a page. Google TOS allows publishers to place up to 3 Google Adsense for Content on a page. If you are using other ads, you may display up to 10 Ads.
* Support up to a maximum of 10 Ads codes on Sidebar Widgets.
* Support up to a maximum of 10 Ads codes for specific placement & randomization within a post.
* Insert Google AdSense ads on-the-fly, insert &lt;!--Ads1--&gt;, &lt;!--Ads2--&gt; ... , &lt;!--RndAds--&gt; to a post to accomplish this.
* Disable Ads on-the-fly, insert &lt;!--NoAds--&gt;, &lt;!--OffDef--&gt;, &lt;!--OffWidget--&gt;, &lt;!--OffBegin--&gt; ... and more to a post to accomplish this.
* The above quicktags can be inserted into a post easily via the additional Quicktag Buttons added to the HTML Edit Post SubPanel.
* Use shortcodes within ads (Suppport advertisements from other ad plugins for example Simple Ads Manager or AdRotate)

= Improvements to original Quick AdSense Ads plugin =

* Performance improvements
* Serialized storing of Ad options instead storing every single option as separate table entry all over
* Multi language support
* Remove of small coding issues like "unexpected output" message when plugin is activated on several sites
* Import / Export function makes plugin migrating to other sites easier. Copy your ads code to other sites.

= Safety improvements = 

* Exit code if Quick AdSense plugin is not called by WordPress directly 
* Better sanitizing of user input

= We Distance Ourself From =
These are known AdSense plugins which are removed from the WordPress repository because of non ethic behavior:

* AdSense Extreme
* AdSense Insert 

Make sure to switch to WP QUADS or any other AdSense plugin if you are still using these plugins!

<h3>WP QUADS PRO:</h3>

* Support for responsive Google AdSense ads
* GUI improvements
